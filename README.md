### Project Overview
---
This project involves analysing customer data for a subscription service to identify subscription patterns and trends. The end result is to understand customer behaviour to subscription, identification of subscription types and the trends in subscription cancellation and renewals. This analysis was carried out based on the customer dataset provided for this project, which was used to derive our objectives and also provides relevant conclusion and recommendations.

### Data Description
---
The dataset includes the following fields:
1. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
2. Customer Name: Individual customer's unique name
3. Region: An area of the country located for sales
5. Subscription Type: name to various subscription services rendered
6. Subscription Start:This is the begining date for a purchased subscription service
7. Subscrption End: Is the end date for a purchased subscription service
8. Canceled: It depict active and inactive subscription
9. Revenue: Total amount generated from subscription services rendered
10. Duration/day: 365 days
11. Duration/month: 12 months
12. Duration/year: 1 year

### Basic Statistics about the Dataset:
1. Total Revenue: N68M
2. Average Sales: N22.5M
5. Number of CustomersID: 34K
6. Subscription Type: 4

 ### Methodology
 ---
### Data Collection
The dataset for this analysis was provided by the Incubator Hub, Lita Data Analysis Dept. The data was provided in Excel and CSV format, making it accessible for analysis.

### Data Manipulation
1. Data Cleaning:
Checked for Spelling Errors, Duplicate Values, and Blank Cells: Ensured data quality by correcting any spelling errors, removing duplicate entries, and addressing missing values.

2. Data Transformation:
Data Types and Formatting: Ensured all data fields were assigned the correct data types and well formated. New columns for subscription duration by day, month and year were added.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
After cleaning the data in excel, pivot table was used for the analysis and then the cleaned data was exported to Structured Query Language for futher analysis and finaly to PowerBi for the creation of interactive dashboard. The following activities were carried out;
* Data Filtering and Segmentation: Filtering was done on Excel and pivot tables allows for segmentation by subscription type, cancellation and renewals which produces a great insight into the data. SQL's GROUP, WHERE and ORDER BY clauses filtered and grouped by product, region, monthly etc also revealed targeted insight while PowerBI segmented insights of Excel and SQL into an interesting report.
* Descriptive Analysis: Metrics calculation was done on Excel for the average subscription duration which reported a period of 12 months which is one year and the most popular subscription type is Basic. SQL queries were written for a futher insight into the subscription pattern and trends and PowerBI was used for visualisation dashboard.
* Dashboard Creation: Pivot table on Excel was used for the summarisation of the dataset and PowerBi dashboard visualizes the data using components like barchat, piechart, donought, table, area chart, tables, cards and slicer.

 ### Tools used
 ---
1. Microsoft Excel: This is used for data cleaning, analysis and creating pivot visualization
2. Structured Query Language for quering data
3. PowerBI for dashboard visualization
